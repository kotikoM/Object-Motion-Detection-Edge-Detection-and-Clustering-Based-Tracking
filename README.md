# Object Motion Detection

A numerical project attempting to detect and measure moving objects in a video (as long as the background is mercifully simple). It relies on clustering and edge detection to do the heavy lifting.

## 🔥Features (or Lack Thereof)
- **Outline Generation**: Can draw outlines around moving objects... given enough time.
- **Velocity Calculation**: Estimates how fast objects are moving in pixels per frame.
- **Handcrafted Implementations**: Most of the key functions are written by hand, meaning minimal optimization and maximum pain.

## 🛠 Technology Stack
- **Python**: Because why not?
- **NumPy**: Handles matrix operations so you don't have to.
- **OpenCV**: Because writing an image processing library from scratch would not be good life choice.

## 📦 Installation
If you really want to run this, make sure you have the following installed:
```sh
pip install numpy opencv-python
```

##  🚀 How to Use
1. Feed it a video with a simple background and adjust the parameters.
2. Let it process (will need some time).
3. Inspect the output. If it's wrong, tweak settings and repeat step 1.
